<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm just a nerdy computer enthusiast. I love working on cool innovative ideas. I love taking multiple components and making them talk to eachother to create a single functional platform.</p>
<p>
  I have over 10 years experience across the board in IT. From building custom computers for customers across Canada to working in a startup environment to being a desk jocky at one of 
  Canadas largest insurance providers. This site is really just a monument of me taking my skills I've gathered over the years and kicking it back to the fundamentals of modern web development.
